  "summary": "The implementation successfully addresses all 12 requirements (REQ-9 through REQ-20) with comprehensive changes to both frontend and backend. The cyberpunk theme is fully implemented with neon blue and electric purple accents throughout. The hero section text matches specifications exactly. A centered search bar is present in the navigation. Four new product categories are implemented in both backend and frontend. Video preview support with hover auto-play is implemented. Guest checkout flow removes authentication requirements. A Mega Bundle section is prominently displayed on the homepage. Frequently Bought Together functionality is implemented on product detail pages. Product detail pages show crossed-out pricing, trust badges, and sticky add-to-cart buttons. Download URLs are in the backend schema and order confirmation displays download links. A DMCA/Copyright page is accessible from the footer. Bullet-point descriptions are rendered on product detail pages.",
